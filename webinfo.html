<h1 align="left">1. Basic information about the web</h1>
<b>What is the Web?</b><br><br>

The web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that can be accessed via the internet.<br><br>

<b>Key Components of the Web</b><br><br>

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring data over the web.<br>
2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): The standard markup language used for creating web pages.<br>
3. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators): Unique addresses used to identify and locate web pages.<br>
4. Web Browsers: Software applications used to access and view web pages (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).<br>
5. Web Servers: Computers that store and serve web pages over the internet.<br><br>

<b>How the Web Works</b><br><br>

1. A user enters a URL into their web browser.
2. The web browser sends an HTTP request to the web server associated with the URL.<br>
3. The web server processes the request and sends the requested web page back to the user's web browser.<br>
4. The web browser renders the web page, allowing the user to view and interact with it.<br><br>

<b>Brief History of the Web</b><br><br>

1. 1989: Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web while working at CERN.<br>
2. 1991: The first web page is launched.<br>
3. 1993: The first web browser, Mosaic, is released.<br>
4. 1994: Netscape Navigator is released, becoming one of the most popular web browsers of the 1990s.<br><br>

<b>Types of Websites</b><br><br>

1. Static Websites: Websites that display fixed content and do not change frequently.<br>
2. Dynamic Websites: Websites that display content that can change frequently, such as news websites or social media platforms.<br>
3. E-commerce Websites: Websites that allow users to purchase products or services online.<br>
4. Blogs: Websites that display articles or posts on a particular topic.<br>
5. Forums: Websites that allow users to discuss topics or ask questions.<br><br>

<b>Web Security</b><br><br>

1. HTTPS: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, a protocol used for secure communication over the web.<br>
2. SSL/TLS: Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security, a protocol used for encrypting data transmitted over the web.<br>
3. Firewalls: Network security systems used to block unauthorized access to websites and networks.<br>
4. Antivirus Software: Software used to detect and remove malware from computers and networks.<br>
